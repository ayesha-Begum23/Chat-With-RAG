# Conversational Q&A Bot with Pinecone and Groq

## Overview

This project implements a Conversational Q&A Bot using Pinecone for vector database management and Groq for generating responses. The bot is designed to interact with users through a web interface built using Streamlit. It also supports document uploading and indexing for enhanced context-aware responses.

## Features

- **Conversational Interface**: Interact with the bot through a chat interface.
- **Document Upload**: Upload PDFs to provide context for better responses.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Uses Pinecone for retrieving relevant documents and Groq for generating responses.
- **Customizable Design**: Styled chat interface with loading indicators.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pinecone account and API key
- Groq API key

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chat-with-RAG.git
    cd Chat-with-RAG
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

    ```bash
    python -m venv myenv
    source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following content:

    ```env
    PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
    GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. **Open the Application**: Navigate to the local Streamlit server URL provided after running the application.

2. **Upload Document**: Use the sidebar to upload a PDF file. The content of the document will be used to provide context for the Q&A.

3. **Interact with the Bot**: Type your questions into the chat input and press "Send" to receive responses from the bot.
